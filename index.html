			<p>This course mainly consist of two parts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Introduction</b> to the topic by working through the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp">w3schools Python Tutorial</a>. The interactive exercises allow us to learn Python efficiently, while focusing directly on its application.</li>
				<li><b>Hands-on</b> coding projects to reinforce and deepen your knowledge of the fundamentals you have learned. You will be able to directly apply and combine newly learned material to complete mini-projects provided on the <a href="https://github.com/STADS-Mannheim/python-course-2024">GitHub site</a>. The proportion of hands-on projects will increase over time.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Python.</b> We will be using Python 3.12 for this course. There are many ways to install Python. If you haven't done so yet, you could use <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/">Miniconda</a> or install Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">globally</a>.</li>
				<li><b>VS Code.</b> We will be working a lot with Jupyter Notebooks. You can use Jupyter Notebooks in your browser, but it is recommended to use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>. Make sure to install the <i>Python</i> and <i>Jupyter</i> Extensions in VS Code.</li>
				<li><b>Git.</b> All code will be provided in a GitHub repository<br><span class="code">https://github.com/STADS-Mannheim/python-course-2024.git</span><br>If you haven't already done so yet, you can install Git as described below. Alternatively, you may find it easier to use <a href="https://desktop.github.com/download/">Github Desktop</a>.
					<ul>
						<li>Windows: Download <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/git">Git for Windows</a> or just type in your admin powershell<br><span class="code">choco install git</span></li>
						<li>Mac: Download <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git">Git for Mac</a> or just type in your terminal<br><span class="code">brew install git</span></li>
					</ul>
					If you are not familiar with Git, you can find a very short guide <a href="https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">here</a>.
