			<ol>
				<li><b>Python.</b> We will be using Python 3.13 for this course. There are many ways to install Python. If you haven't done so yet, you could use <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/">Miniconda</a> or install Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">globally</a>.</li>
				<li><b>VS Code.</b> We will be working a lot with Jupyter Notebooks. You can use Jupyter Notebooks in your browser, but it is recommended to use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>. Make sure to install the <i>Python</i> and <i>Jupyter</i> Extensions in VS Code.</li>
				<li><b>Git.</b> All code will be provided in a GitHub repository<br><span class="code">https://github.com/STADS-Mannheim/python-course-2025.git</span><br>If you haven't already done so yet, you can install Git as described below. <!-- Alternatively, you may find it easier to use <a href="https://desktop.github.com/download/">Github Desktop</a>. -->
					<ul>
						<li>Windows: Download <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/git">Git for Windows</a> or just type in your admin powershell<br><span class="code">choco install git</span></li>
						<li>Mac: Download <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git">Git for Mac</a> or just type in your terminal<br><span class="code">brew install git</span></li>
					</ul>
					If you are not familiar with Git, you can find a very short guide <a href="https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">here</a>.
