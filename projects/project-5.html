			<h1>5: Software Engineers</h1>
			<h3>Task</h3>
			<p>Read in the csv file on US software engineers, analyze the data, and visualize your findings. Answer the following questions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What are the top 3 most sought-after job titles?</li>
				<li>Compare the average company rating of remote vs. non-remote jobs.</li>
				<li>Do full-time remote jobs offer higher salaries than full-time non-remote jobs? <i>(advanced, optional)</i></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You may need to clean the data first. Feel free to use <span class="code">data.csv</span> since it has only the relevant information for this project. But if you want to explore more, you can use <span class="code">full_data.csv</span>.</p>
			<h3>About the Data</h3>
			<p>This dataset contains job listings for software engineers in the US, including various attributes such as job title, company, salary, job type, location, and remote work options. The data includes information on the number of hires needed, company ratings, job urgency, and whether the position is remote or not. This data provides insights into job market trends, remote work, and salary comparisons within the software engineering sector.</p>
